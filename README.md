## About Health Data Application
This is an application to get Health Data samples for AutoML and another types of applications.

According to the WHO, The top global causes of death, in order of total number of lives lost, are associated with three broad topics (source: https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/the-top-10-causes-of-death):

1. Cardiovascular (ischaemic heart disease, stroke), 
2. Respiratory (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lower respiratory infections) and 
3. Neonatal conditions â€“ which include birth asphyxia and birth trauma, neonatal sepsis and infections, and preterm birth complications.

This application provides real data (without personal data) for some of these top 10 scenarios of diseases identified by WHO. The datasets for this application are:
 - **Diabetes dataset**: data to predict diabetes diagnosis
 - **Heart Disease dataset**: data to predict heart disease
 - **Kidney Disease dataset**: data to predict kidney disease
 - **Breast Cancer dataset**: data to predict breast cancer
 - **Maternal Risk dataset**: data to predict maternal risk level
 - **Hospital Mortality dataset**: data to predict hospital mortality
 - **World Life Expectancy dataset**: data to predict life expectancy based in the country social and health indicators 

**NOW WE HAVE 7 DATASETS!!!**

## Installation
1. Clone/git pull the repo into any local directory

```
$ git clone https://github.com/yurimarx/automl-heart.git
```

2. Open a Docker terminal in this directory and run:

```
$ docker-compose build
```

3. Run the IRIS container:

```
$ docker-compose up -d
```
